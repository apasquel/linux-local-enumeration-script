# Linux Local Enumeration Script

The script performs linux enumeration to determine if the box was compromised.  

Copy script to target and execute it: 

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arr0way/linux-local-enumeration-script/master/linux-local-enum.sh
chmod linux-local-enum.sh
./linux-local-enum.sh 
```

The script logs all output to file enum.log, which is created in the script root directory.
